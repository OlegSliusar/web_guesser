# WebGuesser

In this introductory level project, I've used Sinatra to build a number guessing game.

What the app does:
- Generates a random number on startup
- Has a web page where you can enter a guess
- Tells you whether your guess was...
  - Way too high
  - Too high
  - Correct
  - Too low
  - Way too low
- Tells you how many guesses you have left
